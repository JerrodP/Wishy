# Wishy

## A Project for helping me save money on books

The Wishy program's goal is to scrape data from Amazon to get prices and notify users when the price changes. The user will need to provide an IBSN or an ASIN and the rest should be handled, from getting book information to notifying the user of a price change.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to accomplish 5
4 goals to improve my programming skills and familiarity with Python.

1. Follow a consistent design pattern
2. Better understand how Python interacts with objects
3. Create clean UI
4. Integrate an SQL database with CRUD functionality to maintain a list of books

## Further design ideas:
1. Setup virtual machine or server to have program running at all times to update users more consistently
2. Implement user authentification
3. Develop IOS app interface.
4. Edit class structure to add more than just books, ie any Amazon product.
